# Zaheer Jahangir – Filmmaking Portfolio

Welcome to my cinematic world — a portfolio that showcases my journey as an engineer venturing into the art of filmmaking. This is more than just a collection of projects; it is a storytelling experience, presented as acts in a film, where each scroll, animation, and interaction is part of the narrative.

## 🎬 About

I am Zaheer, an engineer passionate about creating films.  
I believe that **ideas and words can change the world**. Inspired by the road less traveled, I am exploring the intersection of technology and storytelling.

This portfolio is designed to give you a **cinematic experience**:

- Scroll through the “acts” of my work as if watching a film unfold.  
- Discover works **in development**, projects **in production**, and releases that **exist in the world**.  
- Experience interactive timelines, animated quotes, and project previews.

## 📖 Structure

The portfolio is structured as a **seven-act journey**, with each section representing a different phase of my creative process:

1. **Act One – Manifesto:** Introduction, personal philosophy, and inspiration.  
2. **Act Two – Inner World:** Works in development, including psychological thrillers and experimental projects.  
3. **Act Three – In Production:** Projects currently being made.  
4. **Act Four – The Premiere:** Completed works released into the world.  
5. **In Between – Cuts:** Stalled or paused projects that are still alive.  
6. **Act Five – After Credits:** Contact and ways to connect.  

Each project and act is accompanied by a **cinematic quote** from classic films and literature.
